# =============================================================================
# Emu-Backup Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Define backup sources, modes, types, and exclusions.
#
# FORMAT:
#   [source-name]
#   path = /path/to/source
#   mode = archive | mirror
#   type = config | save
#   retention = N              (optional, for archive mode)
#   excludes = pattern1 pattern2 pattern3
#
# MODES:
#   archive - Creates timestamped tar.xz archives, auto-prunes old versions
#   mirror  - Direct rsync copy with .previous directory for recovery
#
# TYPES:
#   config - Stored in $configs_dir (default if not specified)
#   save   - Stored in $saves_dir
#
# EXCLUDES:
#   Space-separated patterns. Supports:
#   - Exact folder names: "cache" "logs"
#   - Wildcards: "*.log" "*.tmp"
#   - Paths: "system/Mupen64plus/textures"
#
# HARDCODED EXCLUSIONS (always applied, cannot be overridden):
#   shaders, Shaders, shader_cache, ShaderCache, StaticShaders, GraphicPacks
#   These are large, regenerated automatically, and not needed for backups.

# --- Global Settings ---
[global]
# Backup destinations - configure one or both:
#   - Local only:  Set configs_dir/saves_dir, leave nas_* empty
#   - NAS only:    Set nas_configs_dir/nas_saves_dir, leave local empty
#   - Both:        Set all four - backs up to local first, then syncs to NAS

# Local backup (fast, always available)
